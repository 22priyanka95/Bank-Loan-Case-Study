# Bank-Loan-Case-Study
Project Description 
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter. Suppose you work for a consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. You have to use EDA to analyze the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

When the company receives a loan application, the comapny has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant's profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank's decision:
1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company. 
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loass for the comapny.


When a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decision that could be taken by the company:
1. Approved: The company has approved loan application.
2. Cancelled: The client cancelled the application sometime during approval. Either the client changed his/her mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher risk of the client he received worse pricing which he did not want.
3. Refused: The company had rejected the loan because the client does not meet their requirements.
4. Unused offer: Loan has been cancelled by client but on different stages of the process.
